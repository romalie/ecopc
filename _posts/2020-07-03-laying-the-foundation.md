Today we found out about [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is a free service hosting static web content from a github repository. Hence, we created one named [romalie](https://github.com/romalie) and the repository [ecopc](https://github.com/romalie/ecopc) along with it.

It looks like this is exactly what we've been looking for! It's completely free, we get a nice "webiste builder" along with it ([jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)) that is also - mostly - free and if we want to use a nicer domain, that too is possible with github pages.
